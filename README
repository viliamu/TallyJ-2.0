TallyJ facilitates the recording of ballots and votes at a Bahá'í election. 

It is designed for use at the location of the election, with the completed paper ballots in hand. 

All names on the ballots are typed into one or more computers and on-screen reports provide instant results.

Can be accessed on the web, or installed locally.

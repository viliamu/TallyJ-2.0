TallyJ facilitates the holding of a Bahá'í election. 

An election has two phases for tellers - collecting ballots and counting 
ballots. TallyJ helps with both. 

When collecting ballots, all voters are registered and roll call screen
can be displayed.

When counting ballots, all names on the ballots are typed 
into one or more computers, and on-screen reports provide instant results.

Can be accessed on the web, or installed locally.

Moved to github in March 2016.

To participate in developing TallyJ, please branch from, and merge to, the 'dev' branch. 
The 'uat' and 'live' branches are used for public releases. This is similar to the git-flow
approach described here (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).
